          <h2 class="subtitles">The Cost Of Independence, Is More Dependence</h2>
          <p class="date">Friday 12th March 2021</p>

      <article>
          <p>We generally consider independence - the choice to live how we want, where we want, be who we want, work as
              we want - to be a positive thing. But when might it not be?</p>

          <p>I’m going to argue that perhaps the cost of independence could actually be further dependence. Or, by
              gaining independence in one area, we inevitably become more dependent in another.</p>

          <p>If we look properly at our lives, how independent are we? Did we build the house we live in? The clothes we
              wear? The technology we use? Grow the food we eat? In fact, we are reliant on others for almost all of the
              things we own and consume.</p>

          <p>But life hasn’t always been this way.</p>

          <p>In the good old hunter-gatherer days, we did more for ourselves, whilst also relying more on our tribe. Our
              friends and family were also our house builders, chefs, clothes makers and doctors.</p>

          <p>Sure humans have always tended to specialise at tasks. But never like they do today. We are so specialised
              in our work that we are in effect useless at anything else.</p>

          <p>It is also possible, like no other time in history perhaps, to live completely alone. We can still access
              our basic necessities and more whilst living by ourselves.</p>

          <p>By ourselves I mean without family and friends. Because of course we still are in need of the service
              providers.</p>

          <p>So what have we done?</p>

          <p>We’ve moved our dependence away from our tribes, friends and families, and onto more specialised service
              providers. And governments.</p>

          <p>When we say we’ve gained independence, what we’ve really done is gained independence from our closest
              friends and families.</p>

          <p>But have increased our dependence on strangers.</p>

          <p>This was made potently obvious to me when I spent a month in an economically deprived area of Mexico. The
              people there do not have access to social support. Their houses they often have to build and maintain
              themselves. They needed to rely, often, on their neighbours.</p>

          <p>Despite being nervous initially when entering, I felt almost immediately a part of a community. One that
              knew how to look after one another. I was invited into homes, offered food and drink and friendly
              conversations. Sure it wasn’t always safe. But it felt reassuring to feel a sense of dependence that my
              neighbour had my back, and I reciprocated by having theirs. Circumstances forced them to create a close
              nit community.</p>

          <p><i>Community, community, community.</i></p>

          <p>A word we hear often. We already know it’s important for us. We are, of course, a social species.</p>

          <p>So perhaps it’s time we look for smarter solutions to our growing problems of loneliness and isolation.</p>

          <p>Maybe we should realise that, for our well being and sense of belonging, we aren’t so independent. And that
              for these basic necessities, we are in fact deeply dependent. We are dependent, in the end, on our family
              and friends.</p>
