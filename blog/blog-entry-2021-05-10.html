          Nothing quite brings awareness to the ill state of someone's mental health like suicide does. It displays
          completely the breakdown of someone's mind. I saw a quote once that said something like: "The worst thing
          about seeing someone fall is not being able to convince them that they have the power to save themselves by
          just standing up." But I never saw my cousin fall. Or, maybe I just didn't have the awareness to see
          him falling. I was
          emotionally blind to his suffering. So when he disappeared one morning, it never occurred to me he'd
          decided to disappear forever.

          My cousin, Liam, had made the choice to take his own life on 20th April 2016. He was only 22 at the time.
          Barely
          had he tasted adulthood. And me and him were really close. Best mates close. I'm from a
          large family with many siblings, and he was like another sibling amongst us. But nearly two months earlier
          he had experienced a tragic and traumatic event that led to the death of his mother. I felt responsible to
          help him, so I moved from where I was living to stay with him. And for those two months, he
          seemed, well, fine. Happy even. When we weren't busy in our jobs and studies, we would play videogames,
          drink beers and watch movies together. We sang and laughed. A memory I treasure is us two, after having a
          few beers, singing the "You Got a Friend in Me" song from Toy Story. We grew up in the Toy Story era.
          Watched all the movies; played all the videogames. The song at the time just seemed so right. It was me
          telling him "Look, Liam, we have grown up together. You're like a brother to me. I am
          here for you if you need anything. Remember that."
        </p>
        <p>
          One line from that song goes "You got troubles? Then I got em too". Except when I look back on it, I felt
          at the time as if not only did I carry his troubles, but that mine were heavier than his. What had happened
          to his mother, my Auntie, was difficult for me to cope with. When he remained calm and rational,
          I was the one breaking down in tears. I felt weak.
        </p>

          He studied psychology, me engineering, made me choose this career path. Now doing it for him etc...
